*
*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DLAEBZ contains the iteration loops which compute and use the
*  function N(w), which is the count of eigenvalues of a symmetric
*  tridiagonal matrix T less than or equal to its argument  w.  It
*  performs a choice of two types of loops:
*
*  IJOB=1, followed by
*  IJOB=2: It takes as input a list of intervals and returns a list of
*          sufficiently small intervals whose union contains the same
*          eigenvalues as the union of the original intervals.
*          The input intervals are (AB(j,1),AB(j,2)], j=1,...,MINP.
*          The output interval (AB(j,1),AB(j,2)] will contain
*          eigenvalues NAB(j,1)+1,...,NAB(j,2), where 1 <= j <= MOUT.
*
*  IJOB=3: It performs a binary search in each input interval
*          (AB(j,1),AB(j,2)] for a point  w(j)  such that
*          N(w(j))=NVAL(j), and uses  C(j)  as the starting point of
*          the search.  If such a w(j) is found, then on output
*          AB(j,1)=AB(j,2)=w.  If no such w(j) is found, then on output
*          (AB(j,1),AB(j,2)] will be a small interval containing the
*          point where N(w) jumps through NVAL(j), unless that point
*          lies outside the initial interval.
*
*  Note that the intervals are in all cases half-open intervals,
*  i.e., of the form  (a,b] , which includes  b  but not  a .
*
*  To avoid underflow, the matrix should be scaled so that its largest
*  element is no greater than  overflow**(1/2) * underflow**(1/4)
*  in absolute value.  To assure the most accurate computation
*  of small eigenvalues, the matrix should be scaled to be
*  not much smaller than that, either.
*

*  Matrix", Report CS41, Computer Science Dept., Stanford

*
*  Note: the arguments are, in general, *not* checked for unreasonable
*  values.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  IJOB    (input) INTEGER
*          Specifies what is to be done:
*          = 1:  Compute NAB for the initial intervals.
*          = 2:  Perform bisection iteration to find eigenvalues of T.
*          = 3:  Perform bisection iteration to invert N(w), i.e.,
*                to find a point which has a specified number of
*                eigenvalues of T to its left.
*          Other values will cause DLAEBZ to return with INFO=-1.
*
*  NITMAX  (input) INTEGER
*          The maximum number of "levels" of bisection to be
*          performed, i.e., an interval of width W will not be made
*          smaller than 2^(-NITMAX) * W.  If not all intervals
*          have converged after NITMAX iterations, then INFO is set
*          to the number of non-converged intervals.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The dimension n of the tridiagonal matrix T.  It must be at
*          least 1.
*
*  MMAX    (input) INTEGER
*          The maximum number of intervals.  If more than MMAX intervals
*          are generated, then DLAEBZ will quit with INFO=MMAX+1.
*
*  MINP    (input) INTEGER
*          The initial number of intervals.  It may not be greater than
*          MMAX.
*
*  NBMIN   (input) INTEGER
*          The smallest number of intervals that should be processed
*          using a vector loop.  If zero, then only the scalar loop
*          will be used.
*
*  ABSTOL  (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The minimum (absolute) width of an interval.  When an
*          interval is narrower than ABSTOL, or than RELTOL times the
*          larger (in magnitude) endpoint, then it is considered to be
*          sufficiently small, i.e., converged.  This must be at least
*          zero.
*
*  RELTOL  (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The minimum relative width of an interval.  When an interval
*          is narrower than ABSTOL, or than RELTOL times the larger (in
*          magnitude) endpoint, then it is considered to be
*          sufficiently small, i.e., converged.  Note: this should
*          always be at least radix*machine epsilon.
*
*  PIVMIN  (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The minimum absolute value of a "pivot" in the Sturm
*          sequence loop.  This *must* be at least  max |e(j)**2| *
*          safe_min  and at least safe_min, where safe_min is at least
*          the smallest number that can divide one without overflow.
*
*  D       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          The diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T.
*
*  E       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          The offdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T in
*          positions 1 through N-1.  E(N) is arbitrary.
*
*  E2      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          The squares of the offdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal
*          matrix T.  E2(N) is ignored.
*
*  NVAL    (input/output) INTEGER array, dimension (MINP)
*          If IJOB=1 or 2, not referenced.
*          If IJOB=3, the desired values of N(w).  The elements of NVAL
*          will be reordered to correspond with the intervals in AB.
*          Thus, NVAL(j) on output will not, in general be the same as
*          NVAL(j) on input, but it will correspond with the interval
*          (AB(j,1),AB(j,2)] on output.
*
*  AB      (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MMAX,2)
*          The endpoints of the intervals.  AB(j,1) is  a(j), the left
*          endpoint of the j-th interval, and AB(j,2) is b(j), the
*          right endpoint of the j-th interval.  The input intervals
*          will, in general, be modified, split, and reordered by the
*          calculation.
*
*  C       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MMAX)
*          If IJOB=1, ignored.
*          If IJOB=2, workspace.
*          If IJOB=3, then on input C(j) should be initialized to the
*          first search point in the binary search.
*
*  MOUT    (output) INTEGER
*          If IJOB=1, the number of eigenvalues in the intervals.
*          If IJOB=2 or 3, the number of intervals output.
*          If IJOB=3, MOUT will equal MINP.
*
*  NAB     (input/output) INTEGER array, dimension (MMAX,2)
*          If IJOB=1, then on output NAB(i,j) will be set to N(AB(i,j)).
*          If IJOB=2, then on input, NAB(i,j) should be set.  It must
*             satisfy the condition:
*             N(AB(i,1)) <= NAB(i,1) <= NAB(i,2) <= N(AB(i,2)),
*             which means that in interval i only eigenvalues
*             NAB(i,1)+1,...,NAB(i,2) will be considered.  Usually,
*             NAB(i,j)=N(AB(i,j)), from a previous call to DLAEBZ with
*             IJOB=1.
*             On output, NAB(i,j) will contain
*             max(na(k),min(nb(k),N(AB(i,j)))), where k is the index of
*             the input interval that the output interval
*             (AB(j,1),AB(j,2)] came from, and na(k) and nb(k) are the
*             the input values of NAB(k,1) and NAB(k,2).
*          If IJOB=3, then on output, NAB(i,j) contains N(AB(i,j)),
*             unless N(w) > NVAL(i) for all search points  w , in which
*             case NAB(i,1) will not be modified, i.e., the output
*             value will be the same as the input value (modulo
*             reorderings -- see NVAL and AB), or unless N(w) < NVAL(i)
*             for all search points  w , in which case NAB(i,2) will
*             not be modified.  Normally, NAB should be set to some
*             distinctive value(s) before DLAEBZ is called.
*
*  WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MMAX)
*          Workspace.
*
*  IWORK   (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (MMAX)
*          Workspace.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:       All intervals converged.
*          = 1--MMAX: The last INFO intervals did not converge.
*          = MMAX+1:  More than MMAX intervals were generated.
*
*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*      This routine is intended to be called only by other LAPACK
*  routines, thus the interface is less user-friendly.  It is intended
*  for two purposes:
*
*  (a) finding eigenvalues.  In this case, DLAEBZ should have one or
*      more initial intervals set up in AB, and DLAEBZ should be called
*      with IJOB=1.  This sets up NAB, and also counts the eigenvalues.
*      Intervals with no eigenvalues would usually be thrown out at
*      this point.  Also, if not all the eigenvalues in an interval i
*      are desired, NAB(i,1) can be increased or NAB(i,2) decreased.
*      For example, set NAB(i,1)=NAB(i,2)-1 to get the largest
*      eigenvalue.  DLAEBZ is then called with IJOB=2 and MMAX
*      no smaller than the value of MOUT returned by the call with
*      IJOB=1.  After this (IJOB=2) call, eigenvalues NAB(i,1)+1
*      through NAB(i,2) are approximately AB(i,1) (or AB(i,2)) to the
*      tolerance specified by ABSTOL and RELTOL.
*
*  (b) finding an interval (a',b'] containing eigenvalues w(f),...,w(l).
*      In this case, start with a Gershgorin interval  (a,b).  Set up
*      AB to contain 2 search intervals, both initially (a,b).  One
*      NVAL element should contain  f-1  and the other should contain  l
*      , while C should contain a and b, resp.  NAB(i,1) should be -1
*      and NAB(i,2) should be N+1, to flag an error if the desired
*      interval does not lie in (a,b).  DLAEBZ is then called with
*      IJOB=3.  On exit, if w(f-1) < w(f), then one of the intervals --
*      j -- will have AB(j,1)=AB(j,2) and NAB(j,1)=NAB(j,2)=f-1, while
*      if, to the specified tolerance, w(f-k)=...=w(f+r), k > 0 and r

*     .. Scalar Arguments ..
      DOUBLE PRECISION   A, B, C, CS1, RT1, RT2, SN1
*     ..
*
*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DLAEV2 computes the eigendecomposition of a 2-by-2 symmetric matrix
*     [  A   B  ]
*     [  B   C  ].
*  On return, RT1 is the eigenvalue of larger absolute value, RT2 is the
*  eigenvalue of smaller absolute value, and (CS1,SN1) is the unit right
*  eigenvector for RT1, giving the decomposition
*
*     [ CS1  SN1 ] [  A   B  ] [ CS1 -SN1 ]  =  [ RT1  0  ]
*     [-SN1  CS1 ] [  B   C  ] [ SN1  CS1 ]     [  0  RT2 ].
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  A       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The (1,1) element of the 2-by-2 matrix.
*
*  B       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The (1,2) element and the conjugate of the (2,1) element of
*          the 2-by-2 matrix.
*
*  C       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The (2,2) element of the 2-by-2 matrix.
*
*  RT1     (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The eigenvalue of larger absolute value.
*
*  RT2     (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The eigenvalue of smaller absolute value.
*
*  CS1     (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*  SN1     (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The vector (CS1, SN1) is a unit right eigenvector for RT1.
*
*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*  RT1 is accurate to a few ulps barring over/underflow.
*
*  RT2 may be inaccurate if there is massive cancellation in the
*  determinant A*C-B*B; higher precision or correctly rounded or
*  correctly truncated arithmetic would be needed to compute RT2
*  accurately in all cases.
*
*  CS1 and SN1 are accurate to a few ulps barring over/underflow.
*
*  Overflow is possible only if RT1 is within a factor of 5 of overflow.
*  Underflow is harmless if the input data is 0 or exceeds
*     underflow_threshold / macheps.

*
*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DLAGTF factorizes the matrix (T - lambda*I), where T is an n by n
*  tridiagonal matrix and lambda is a scalar, as
*
*     T - lambda*I = PLU,
*
*  where P is a permutation matrix, L is a unit lower tridiagonal matrix
*  with at most one non-zero sub-diagonal elements per column and U is
*  an upper triangular matrix with at most two non-zero super-diagonal
*  elements per column.
*
*  The factorization is obtained by Gaussian elimination with partial
*  pivoting and implicit row scaling.
*
*  The parameter LAMBDA is included in the routine so that DLAGTF may
*  be used, in conjunction with DLAGTS, to obtain eigenvectors of T by
*  inverse iteration.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix T.
*
*  A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          On entry, A must contain the diagonal elements of T.
*
*          On exit, A is overwritten by the n diagonal elements of the
*          upper triangular matrix U of the factorization of T.
*
*  LAMBDA  (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          On entry, the scalar lambda.
*
*  B       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
*          On entry, B must contain the (n-1) super-diagonal elements of
*          T.
*
*          On exit, B is overwritten by the (n-1) super-diagonal
*          elements of the matrix U of the factorization of T.
*
*  C       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
*          On entry, C must contain the (n-1) sub-diagonal elements of
*          T.
*
*          On exit, C is overwritten by the (n-1) sub-diagonal elements
*          of the matrix L of the factorization of T.
*
*  TOL     (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          On entry, a relative tolerance used to indicate whether or
*          not the matrix (T - lambda*I) is nearly singular. TOL should
*          normally be chose as approximately the largest relative error
*          in the elements of T. For example, if the elements of T are
*          correct to about 4 significant figures, then TOL should be
*          set to about 5*10**(-4). If TOL is supplied as less than eps,
*          where eps is the relative machine precision, then the value
*          eps is used in place of TOL.
*
*  D       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-2)
*          On exit, D is overwritten by the (n-2) second super-diagonal
*          elements of the matrix U of the factorization of T.
*
*  IN      (output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          On exit, IN contains details of the permutation matrix P. If
*          an interchange occurred at the kth step of the elimination,
*          then IN(k) = 1, otherwise IN(k) = 0. The element IN(n)
*          returns the smallest positive integer j such that
*
*             abs( u(j,j) ).le. norm( (T - lambda*I)(j) )*TOL,
*
*          where norm( A(j) ) denotes the sum of the absolute values of
*          the jth row of the matrix A. If no such j exists then IN(n)
*          is returned as zero. If IN(n) is returned as positive, then a
*          diagonal element of U is small, indicating that
*          (T - lambda*I) is singular or nearly singular,
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0   : successful exit
*          .lt. 0: if INFO = -k, the kth argument had an illegal value

*
*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DLAGTS may be used to solve one of the systems of equations
*
*     (T - lambda*I)*x = y   or   (T - lambda*I)**T*x = y,
*
*  where T is an n by n tridiagonal matrix, for x, following the
*  factorization of (T - lambda*I) as
*
*     (T - lambda*I) = P*L*U ,
*
*  by routine DLAGTF. The choice of equation to be solved is
*  controlled by the argument JOB, and in each case there is an option
*  to perturb zero or very small diagonal elements of U, this option
*  being intended for use in applications such as inverse iteration.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  JOB     (input) INTEGER
*          Specifies the job to be performed by DLAGTS as follows:
*          =  1: The equations  (T - lambda*I)x = y  are to be solved,
*                but diagonal elements of U are not to be perturbed.
*          = -1: The equations  (T - lambda*I)x = y  are to be solved
*                and, if overflow would otherwise occur, the diagonal
*                elements of U are to be perturbed. See argument TOL
*                below.
*          =  2: The equations  (T - lambda*I)**Tx = y  are to be solved,
*                but diagonal elements of U are not to be perturbed.
*          = -2: The equations  (T - lambda*I)**Tx = y  are to be solved
*                and, if overflow would otherwise occur, the diagonal
*                elements of U are to be perturbed. See argument TOL
*                below.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix T.
*
*  A       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          On entry, A must contain the diagonal elements of U as
*          returned from DLAGTF.
*
*  B       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
*          On entry, B must contain the first super-diagonal elements of
*          U as returned from DLAGTF.
*
*  C       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
*          On entry, C must contain the sub-diagonal elements of L as
*          returned from DLAGTF.
*
*  D       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-2)
*          On entry, D must contain the second super-diagonal elements
*          of U as returned from DLAGTF.
*
*  IN      (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          On entry, IN must contain details of the matrix P as returned
*          from DLAGTF.
*
*  Y       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          On entry, the right hand side vector y.
*          On exit, Y is overwritten by the solution vector x.
*
*  TOL     (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          On entry, with  JOB .lt. 0, TOL should be the minimum
*          perturbation to be made to very small diagonal elements of U.
*          TOL should normally be chosen as about eps*norm(U), where eps
*          is the relative machine precision, but if TOL is supplied as
*          non-positive, then it is reset to eps*max( abs( u(i,j) ) ).
*          If  JOB .gt. 0  then TOL is not referenced.
*
*          On exit, TOL is changed as described above, only if TOL is
*          non-positive on entry. Otherwise TOL is unchanged.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0   : successful exit
*          .lt. 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          .gt. 0: overflow would occur when computing the INFO(th)
*                  element of the solution vector x. This can only occur
*                  when JOB is supplied as positive and either means
*                  that a diagonal element of U is very small, or that
*                  the elements of the right-hand side vector y are very
*                  large.

*
*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  This routine is not for general use.  It exists solely to avoid
*  over-optimization in DISNAN.
*
*  DLAISNAN checks for NaNs by comparing its two arguments for
*  inequality.  NaN is the only floating-point value where NaN != NaN
*  returns .TRUE.  To check for NaNs, pass the same variable as both
*  arguments.
*
*  A compiler must assume that the two arguments are
*  not the same variable, and the test will not be optimized away.
*  Interprocedural or whole-program optimization may delete this
*  test.  The ISNAN functions will be replaced by the correct
*  Fortran 03 intrinsic once the intrinsic is widely available.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  DIN1    (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*
*  DIN2    (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          Two numbers to compare for inequality.

*
*        H = I - tau * v * v**T
*
*  where tau is a real scalar and v is a real vector.
*
*  If tau = 0, then H is taken to be the unit matrix.

*
*  -- LAPACK auxiliary routine (version 3.2) --
*  -- LAPACK is a software package provided by Univ. of Tennessee,    --
*  -- Univ. of California Berkeley, Univ. of Colorado Denver and NAG Ltd..--
*     November 2006
*
*     .. Scalar Arguments ..
      DOUBLE PRECISION   CS, F, G, R, SN
*     ..
*
*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DLARTG generate a plane rotation so that
*
*     [  CS  SN  ]  .  [ F ]  =  [ R ]   where CS**2 + SN**2 = 1.
*     [ -SN  CS  ]     [ G ]     [ 0 ]
*
*  This is a slower, more accurate version of the BLAS1 routine DROTG,
*  with the following other differences:
*     F and G are unchanged on return.
*     If G=0, then CS=1 and SN=0.
*     If F=0 and (G .ne. 0), then CS=0 and SN=1 without doing any
*        floating point operations (saves work in DBDSQR when
*        there are zeros on the diagonal).
*
*  If F exceeds G in magnitude, CS will be positive.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  F       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The first component of vector to be rotated.
*
*  G       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The second component of vector to be rotated.
*
*  CS      (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The cosine of the rotation.
*
*  SN      (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The sine of the rotation.
*
*  R       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The nonzero component of the rotated vector.
*
*  This version has a few statements commented out for thread safety

*
*  -- LAPACK auxiliary routine (version 3.2) --
*  -- LAPACK is a software package provided by Univ. of Tennessee,    --
*  -- Univ. of California Berkeley, Univ. of Colorado Denver and NAG Ltd..--

      DOUBLE PRECISION   X( N )
*     ..
*
*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DLARUV returns a vector of n random real numbers from a uniform (0,1)
*  distribution (n <= 128).
*
*  This is an auxiliary routine called by DLARNV and ZLARNV.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  ISEED   (input/output) INTEGER array, dimension (4)
*          On entry, the seed of the random number generator; the array
*          elements must be between 0 and 4095, and ISEED(4) must be
*          odd.
*          On exit, the seed is updated.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of random numbers to be generated. N <= 128.
*
*  X       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          The generated random numbers.
*
*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*  This routine uses a multiplicative congruential method with modulus
*  2**48 and multiplier 33952834046453 (see G.S.Fishman,
*  'Multiplicative congruential random number generators with modulus
*  2**b: an exhaustive analysis for b = 32 and a partial analysis for
*  b = 48', Math. Comp. 189, pp 331-344, 1990).
*
*  48-bit integers are stored in 4 integer array elements with 12 bits
*  per element. Hence the routine is portable across machines with
*  integers of 32 bits or more.

*  =======
*
*  DLASCL multiplies the M by N real matrix A by the real scalar
*  CTO/CFROM.  This is done without over/underflow as long as the final
*  result CTO*A(I,J)/CFROM does not over/underflow. TYPE specifies that
*  A may be full, upper triangular, lower triangular, upper Hessenberg,
*  or banded.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  TYPE    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          TYPE indices the storage type of the input matrix.
*          = 'G':  A is a full matrix.
*          = 'L':  A is a lower triangular matrix.
*          = 'U':  A is an upper triangular matrix.
*          = 'H':  A is an upper Hessenberg matrix.
*          = 'B':  A is a symmetric band matrix with lower bandwidth KL
*                  and upper bandwidth KU and with the only the lower
*                  half stored.
*          = 'Q':  A is a symmetric band matrix with lower bandwidth KL
*                  and upper bandwidth KU and with the only the upper
*                  half stored.
*          = 'Z':  A is a band matrix with lower bandwidth KL and upper
*                  bandwidth KU. See DGBTRF for storage details.

*  
*  When PIVOT = 'T' (Top pivot), the rotation is performed for the

*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*  If UPLO = 'U', the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary
*  reflectors
*
*     Q = H(n) H(n-1) . . . H(n-nb+1).
*
*  Each H(i) has the form
*
*     H(i) = I - tau * v * v**T
*
*  where tau is a real scalar, and v is a real vector with
*  v(i:n) = 0 and v(i-1) = 1; v(1:i-1) is stored on exit in A(1:i-1,i),
*  and tau in TAU(i-1).
*
*  If UPLO = 'L', the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary
*  reflectors
*
*     Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(nb).
*
*  Each H(i) has the form
*
*     H(i) = I - tau * v * v**T
*
*  where tau is a real scalar, and v is a real vector with
*  v(1:i) = 0 and v(i+1) = 1; v(i+1:n) is stored on exit in A(i+1:n,i),
*  and tau in TAU(i).
*
*  The elements of the vectors v together form the n-by-nb matrix V
*  which is needed, with W, to apply the transformation to the unreduced
*  part of the matrix, using a symmetric rank-2k update of the form:
*  A := A - V*W**T - W*V**T.
*
*  The contents of A on exit are illustrated by the following examples
*  with n = 5 and nb = 2:
*
*  if UPLO = 'U':                       if UPLO = 'L':
*
*    (  a   a   a   v4  v5 )              (  d                  )
*    (      a   a   v4  v5 )              (  1   d              )
*    (          a   1   v5 )              (  v1  1   a          )
*    (              d   1  )              (  v1  v2  a   a      )
*    (                  d  )              (  v1  v2  a   a   a  )
*
*  where d denotes a diagonal element of the reduced matrix, a denotes
*  an element of the original matrix that is unchanged, and vi denotes
*  an element of the vector defining H(i).

*  which is defined as the first N columns of a product of K elementary
*  reflectors of order M
*
*        Q  =  H(1) H(2) . . . H(k)
*
*  as returned by DGEQRF.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========

*          The number of rows of the matrix Q. M >= 0.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of columns of the matrix Q. M >= N >= 0.
*
*  K       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of elementary reflectors whose product defines the
*          matrix Q. N >= K >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
*          On entry, the i-th column must contain the vector which
*          defines the elementary reflector H(i), for i = 1,2,...,k, as
*          returned by DGEQRF in the first k columns of its array
*          argument A.
*          On exit, the M-by-N matrix Q.

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DSTEBZ computes the eigenvalues of a symmetric tridiagonal
*  matrix T.  The user may ask for all eigenvalues, all eigenvalues
*  in the half-open interval (VL, VU], or the IL-th through IU-th
*  eigenvalues.
*
*  To avoid overflow, the matrix must be scaled so that its
*  largest element is no greater than overflow**(1/2) *
*  underflow**(1/4) in absolute value, and for greatest
*  accuracy, it should not be much smaller than that.
*
*  See W. Kahan "Accurate Eigenvalues of a Symmetric Tridiagonal
*  Matrix", Report CS41, Computer Science Dept., Stanford
*  University, July 21, 1966.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  RANGE   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'A': ("All")   all eigenvalues will be found.
*          = 'V': ("Value") all eigenvalues in the half-open interval
*                           (VL, VU] will be found.
*          = 'I': ("Index") the IL-th through IU-th eigenvalues (of the
*                           entire matrix) will be found.
*
*  ORDER   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'B': ("By Block") the eigenvalues will be grouped by
*                              split-off block (see IBLOCK, ISPLIT) and
*                              ordered from smallest to largest within
*                              the block.
*          = 'E': ("Entire matrix")
*                              the eigenvalues for the entire matrix
*                              will be ordered from smallest to
*                              largest.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the tridiagonal matrix T.  N >= 0.
*
*  VL      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*  VU      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          If RANGE='V', the lower and upper bounds of the interval to
*          be searched for eigenvalues.  Eigenvalues less than or equal
*          to VL, or greater than VU, will not be returned.  VL < VU.
*          Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'I'.
*
*  IL      (input) INTEGER
*  IU      (input) INTEGER
*          If RANGE='I', the indices (in ascending order) of the
*          smallest and largest eigenvalues to be returned.
*          1 <= IL <= IU <= N, if N > 0; IL = 1 and IU = 0 if N = 0.
*          Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'V'.
*
*  ABSTOL  (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The absolute tolerance for the eigenvalues.  An eigenvalue
*          (or cluster) is considered to be located if it has been
*          determined to lie in an interval whose width is ABSTOL or
*          less.  If ABSTOL is less than or equal to zero, then ULP*|T|
*          will be used, where |T| means the 1-norm of T.
*
*          Eigenvalues will be computed most accurately when ABSTOL is
*          set to twice the underflow threshold 2*DLAMCH('S'), not zero.
*
*  D       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          The n diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T.
*
*  E       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
*          The (n-1) off-diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T.
*
*  M       (output) INTEGER
*          The actual number of eigenvalues found. 0 <= M <= N.
*          (See also the description of INFO=2,3.)
*
*  NSPLIT  (output) INTEGER
*          The number of diagonal blocks in the matrix T.
*          1 <= NSPLIT <= N.
*
*  W       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          On exit, the first M elements of W will contain the
*          eigenvalues.  (DSTEBZ may use the remaining N-M elements as
*          workspace.)
*
*  IBLOCK  (output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          At each row/column j where E(j) is zero or small, the
*          matrix T is considered to split into a block diagonal
*          matrix.  On exit, if INFO = 0, IBLOCK(i) specifies to which
*          block (from 1 to the number of blocks) the eigenvalue W(i)
*          belongs.  (DSTEBZ may use the remaining N-M elements as
*          workspace.)
*
*  ISPLIT  (output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          The splitting points, at which T breaks up into submatrices.
*          The first submatrix consists of rows/columns 1 to ISPLIT(1),
*          the second of rows/columns ISPLIT(1)+1 through ISPLIT(2),
*          etc., and the NSPLIT-th consists of rows/columns
*          ISPLIT(NSPLIT-1)+1 through ISPLIT(NSPLIT)=N.
*          (Only the first NSPLIT elements will actually be used, but
*          since the user cannot know a priori what value NSPLIT will
*          have, N words must be reserved for ISPLIT.)
*
*  WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (4*N)
*
*  IWORK   (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (3*N)
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  some or all of the eigenvalues failed to converge or
*                were not computed:
*                =1 or 3: Bisection failed to converge for some
*                        eigenvalues; these eigenvalues are flagged by a
*                        negative block number.  The effect is that the
*                        eigenvalues may not be as accurate as the
*                        absolute and relative tolerances.  This is
*                        generally caused by unexpectedly inaccurate
*                        arithmetic.
*                =2 or 3: RANGE='I' only: Not all of the eigenvalues
*                        IL:IU were found.
*                        Effect: M < IU+1-IL
*                        Cause:  non-monotonic arithmetic, causing the
*                                Sturm sequence to be non-monotonic.
*                        Cure:   recalculate, using RANGE='A', and pick
*                                out eigenvalues IL:IU.  In some cases,
*                                increasing the PARAMETER "FUDGE" may
*                                make things work.
*                = 4:    RANGE='I', and the Gershgorin interval
*                        initially used was too small.  No eigenvalues
*                        were computed.
*                        Probable cause: your machine has sloppy
*                                        floating-point arithmetic.
*                        Cure: Increase the PARAMETER "FUDGE",
*                              recompile, and try again.
*
*  Internal Parameters
*  ===================
*
*  RELFAC  DOUBLE PRECISION, default = 2.0e0
*          The relative tolerance.  An interval (a,b] lies within
*          "relative tolerance" if  b-a < RELFAC*ulp*max(|a|,|b|),
*          where "ulp" is the machine precision (distance from 1 to
*          the next larger floating point number.)
*
*  FUDGE   DOUBLE PRECISION, default = 2
*          A "fudge factor" to widen the Gershgorin intervals.  Ideally,
*          a value of 1 should work, but on machines with sloppy
*          arithmetic, this needs to be larger.  The default for
*          publicly released versions should be large enough to handle
*          the worst machine around.  Note that this has no effect
*          on accuracy of the solution.

*     ..
*
*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DSTEIN computes the eigenvectors of a real symmetric tridiagonal
*  matrix T corresponding to specified eigenvalues, using inverse
*  iteration.
*
*  The maximum number of iterations allowed for each eigenvector is
*  specified by an internal parameter MAXITS (currently set to 5).
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix.  N >= 0.
*
*  D       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          The n diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T.
*
*  E       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
*          The (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix
*          T, in elements 1 to N-1.
*
*  M       (input) INTEGER
*          The number of eigenvectors to be found.  0 <= M <= N.
*
*  W       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          The first M elements of W contain the eigenvalues for
*          which eigenvectors are to be computed.  The eigenvalues
*          should be grouped by split-off block and ordered from
*          smallest to largest within the block.  ( The output array
*          W from DSTEBZ with ORDER = 'B' is expected here. )
*
*  IBLOCK  (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          The submatrix indices associated with the corresponding
*          eigenvalues in W; IBLOCK(i)=1 if eigenvalue W(i) belongs to
*          the first submatrix from the top, =2 if W(i) belongs to
*          the second submatrix, etc.  ( The output array IBLOCK
*          from DSTEBZ is expected here. )
*
*  ISPLIT  (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          The splitting points, at which T breaks up into submatrices.
*          The first submatrix consists of rows/columns 1 to
*          ISPLIT( 1 ), the second of rows/columns ISPLIT( 1 )+1
*          through ISPLIT( 2 ), etc.
*          ( The output array ISPLIT from DSTEBZ is expected here. )
*
*  Z       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDZ, M)
*          The computed eigenvectors.  The eigenvector associated
*          with the eigenvalue W(i) is stored in the i-th column of
*          Z.  Any vector which fails to converge is set to its current
*          iterate after MAXITS iterations.
*
*  LDZ     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= max(1,N).
*
*  WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (5*N)
*
*  IWORK   (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*
*  IFAIL   (output) INTEGER array, dimension (M)
*          On normal exit, all elements of IFAIL are zero.
*          If one or more eigenvectors fail to converge after
*          MAXITS iterations, then their indices are stored in
*          array IFAIL.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0: successful exit.
*          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0: if INFO = i, then i eigenvectors failed to converge
*               in MAXITS iterations.  Their indices are stored in
*               array IFAIL.
*
*  Internal Parameters
*  ===================
*
*  MAXITS  INTEGER, default = 5
*          The maximum number of iterations performed.
*
*  EXTRA   INTEGER, default = 2
*          The number of iterations performed after norm growth
*          criterion is satisfied, should be at least 1.

*
*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DSTEQR computes all eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of a
*  symmetric tridiagonal matrix using the implicit QL or QR method.
*  The eigenvectors of a full or band symmetric matrix can also be found
*  if DSYTRD or DSPTRD or DSBTRD has been used to reduce this matrix to
*  tridiagonal form.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  COMPZ   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only.
*          = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the original
*                  symmetric matrix.  On entry, Z must contain the
*                  orthogonal matrix used to reduce the original matrix
*                  to tridiagonal form.
*          = 'I':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the
*                  tridiagonal matrix.  Z is initialized to the identity
*                  matrix.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix.  N >= 0.
*
*  D       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          On entry, the diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix.
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, the eigenvalues in ascending order.
*
*  E       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
*          On entry, the (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal
*          matrix.
*          On exit, E has been destroyed.
*
*  Z       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDZ, N)
*          On entry, if  COMPZ = 'V', then Z contains the orthogonal
*          matrix used in the reduction to tridiagonal form.
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, then if  COMPZ = 'V', Z contains the
*          orthonormal eigenvectors of the original symmetric matrix,
*          and if COMPZ = 'I', Z contains the orthonormal eigenvectors
*          of the symmetric tridiagonal matrix.
*          If COMPZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.
*
*  LDZ     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
*          eigenvectors are desired, then  LDZ >= max(1,N).
*
*  WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (max(1,2*N-2))
*          If COMPZ = 'N', then WORK is not referenced.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  the algorithm has failed to find all the eigenvalues in
*                a total of 30*N iterations; if INFO = i, then i
*                elements of E have not converged to zero; on exit, D
*                and E contain the elements of a symmetric tridiagonal
*                matrix which is orthogonally similar to the original
*                matrix.

*
*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  DSYEVX computes selected eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors
*  of a real symmetric matrix A.  Eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be
*  selected by specifying either a range of values or a range of indices
*  for the desired eigenvalues.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  JOBZ    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;
*          = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
*
*  RANGE   (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'A': all eigenvalues will be found.
*          = 'V': all eigenvalues in the half-open interval (VL,VU]
*                 will be found.
*          = 'I': the IL-th through IU-th eigenvalues will be found.
*
*  UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
*          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
*
*  A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA, N)
*          On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the
*          leading N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the
*          upper triangular part of the matrix A.  If UPLO = 'L',
*          the leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains
*          the lower triangular part of the matrix A.
*          On exit, the lower triangle (if UPLO='L') or the upper
*          triangle (if UPLO='U') of A, including the diagonal, is
*          destroyed.
*
*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
*
*  VL      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*  VU      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          If RANGE='V', the lower and upper bounds of the interval to
*          be searched for eigenvalues. VL < VU.
*          Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'I'.
*
*  IL      (input) INTEGER
*  IU      (input) INTEGER
*          If RANGE='I', the indices (in ascending order) of the
*          smallest and largest eigenvalues to be returned.
*          1 <= IL <= IU <= N, if N > 0; IL = 1 and IU = 0 if N = 0.
*          Not referenced if RANGE = 'A' or 'V'.
*
*  ABSTOL  (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
*          The absolute error tolerance for the eigenvalues.
*          An approximate eigenvalue is accepted as converged
*          when it is determined to lie in an interval [a,b]
*          of width less than or equal to
*
*                  ABSTOL + EPS *   max( |a|,|b| ) ,
*
*          where EPS is the machine precision.  If ABSTOL is less than
*          or equal to zero, then  EPS*|T|  will be used in its place,
*          where |T| is the 1-norm of the tridiagonal matrix obtained
*          by reducing A to tridiagonal form.
*
*          Eigenvalues will be computed most accurately when ABSTOL is
*          set to twice the underflow threshold 2*DLAMCH('S'), not zero.
*          If this routine returns with INFO>0, indicating that some
*          eigenvectors did not converge, try setting ABSTOL to
*          2*DLAMCH('S').
*
*          See "Computing Small Singular Values of Bidiagonal Matrices
*          with Guaranteed High Relative Accuracy," by Demmel and
*          Kahan, LAPACK Working Note #3.
*
*  M       (output) INTEGER
*          The total number of eigenvalues found.  0 <= M <= N.
*          If RANGE = 'A', M = N, and if RANGE = 'I', M = IU-IL+1.
*
*  W       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
*          On normal exit, the first M elements contain the selected
*          eigenvalues in ascending order.
*
*  Z       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDZ, max(1,M))
*          If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, the first M columns of Z
*          contain the orthonormal eigenvectors of the matrix A
*          corresponding to the selected eigenvalues, with the i-th
*          column of Z holding the eigenvector associated with W(i).
*          If an eigenvector fails to converge, then that column of Z
*          contains the latest approximation to the eigenvector, and the
*          index of the eigenvector is returned in IFAIL.
*          If JOBZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.
*          Note: the user must ensure that at least max(1,M) columns are
*          supplied in the array Z; if RANGE = 'V', the exact value of M
*          is not known in advance and an upper bound must be used.
*
*  LDZ     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
*          JOBZ = 'V', LDZ >= max(1,N).
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The length of the array WORK.  LWORK >= 1, when N <= 1;
*          otherwise 8*N.
*          For optimal efficiency, LWORK >= (NB+3)*N,
*          where NB is the max of the blocksize for DSYTRD and DORMTR
*          returned by ILAENV.
*
*          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
*          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
*          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
*          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
*
*  IWORK   (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (5*N)
*
*  IFAIL   (output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
*          If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, the first M elements of
*          IFAIL are zero.  If INFO > 0, then IFAIL contains the
*          indices of the eigenvectors that failed to converge.
*          If JOBZ = 'N', then IFAIL is not referenced.
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*          > 0:  if INFO = i, then i eigenvectors failed to converge.
*                Their indices are stored in array IFAIL.

*
*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  ILAENV is called from the LAPACK routines to choose problem-dependent
*  parameters for the local environment.  See ISPEC for a description of
*  the parameters.
*
*  ILAENV returns an INTEGER
*  if ILAENV >= 0: ILAENV returns the value of the parameter specified by ISPEC
*  if ILAENV < 0:  if ILAENV = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value.
*
*  This version provides a set of parameters which should give good,
*  but not optimal, performance on many of the currently available
*  computers.  Users are encouraged to modify this subroutine to set
*  the tuning parameters for their particular machine using the option
*  and problem size information in the arguments.
*
*  This routine will not function correctly if it is converted to all
*  lower case.  Converting it to all upper case is allowed.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  ISPEC   (input) INTEGER
*          Specifies the parameter to be returned as the value of
*          ILAENV.
*          = 1: the optimal blocksize; if this value is 1, an unblocked
*               algorithm will give the best performance.
*          = 2: the minimum block size for which the block routine
*               should be used; if the usable block size is less than
*               this value, an unblocked routine should be used.
*          = 3: the crossover point (in a block routine, for N less
*               than this value, an unblocked routine should be used)
*          = 4: the number of shifts, used in the nonsymmetric
*               eigenvalue routines (DEPRECATED)
*          = 5: the minimum column dimension for blocking to be used;
*               rectangular blocks must have dimension at least k by m,
*               where k is given by ILAENV(2,...) and m by ILAENV(5,...)
*          = 6: the crossover point for the SVD (when reducing an m by n
*               matrix to bidiagonal form, if max(m,n)/min(m,n) exceeds
*               this value, a QR factorization is used first to reduce
*               the matrix to a triangular form.)
*          = 7: the number of processors
*          = 8: the crossover point for the multishift QR method
*               for nonsymmetric eigenvalue problems (DEPRECATED)
*          = 9: maximum size of the subproblems at the bottom of the
*               computation tree in the divide-and-conquer algorithm
*               (used by xGELSD and xGESDD)
*          =10: ieee NaN arithmetic can be trusted not to trap
*          =11: infinity arithmetic can be trusted not to trap
*          12 <= ISPEC <= 16:
*               xHSEQR or one of its subroutines,
*               see IPARMQ for detailed explanation
*
*  NAME    (input) CHARACTER*(*)
*          The name of the calling subroutine, in either upper case or
*          lower case.
*
*  OPTS    (input) CHARACTER*(*)
*          The character options to the subroutine NAME, concatenated
*          into a single character string.  For example, UPLO = 'U',
*          TRANS = 'T', and DIAG = 'N' for a triangular routine would
*          be specified as OPTS = 'UTN'.
*
*  N1      (input) INTEGER
*  N2      (input) INTEGER
*  N3      (input) INTEGER
*  N4      (input) INTEGER
*          Problem dimensions for the subroutine NAME; these may not all
*          be required.
*
*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*  The following conventions have been used when calling ILAENV from the
*  LAPACK routines:
*  1)  OPTS is a concatenation of all of the character options to
*      subroutine NAME, in the same order that they appear in the
*      argument list for NAME, even if they are not used in determining
*      the value of the parameter specified by ISPEC.
*  2)  The problem dimensions N1, N2, N3, N4 are specified in the order
*      that they appear in the argument list for NAME.  N1 is used
*      first, N2 second, and so on, and unused problem dimensions are
*      passed a value of -1.
*  3)  The parameter value returned by ILAENV is checked for validity in
*      the calling subroutine.  For example, ILAENV is used to retrieve
*      the optimal blocksize for STRTRI as follows:
*
*      NB = ILAENV( 1, 'STRTRI', UPLO // DIAG, N, -1, -1, -1 )
*      IF( NB.LE.1 ) NB = MAX( 1, N )

*
*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*       This program sets problem and machine dependent parameters
*       useful for xHSEQR and its subroutines. It is called whenever 
*       ILAENV is called with 12 <= ISPEC <= 16
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*       ISPEC  (input) integer scalar
*              ISPEC specifies which tunable parameter IPARMQ should
*              return.
*
*              ISPEC=12: (INMIN)  Matrices of order nmin or less
*                        are sent directly to xLAHQR, the implicit
*                        double shift QR algorithm.  NMIN must be
*                        at least 11.
*
*              ISPEC=13: (INWIN)  Size of the deflation window.
*                        This is best set greater than or equal to
*                        the number of simultaneous shifts NS.
*                        Larger matrices benefit from larger deflation
*                        windows.
*
*              ISPEC=14: (INIBL) Determines when to stop nibbling and
*                        invest in an (expensive) multi-shift QR sweep.
*                        If the aggressive early deflation subroutine
*                        finds LD converged eigenvalues from an order
*                        NW deflation window and LD.GT.(NW*NIBBLE)/100,
*                        then the next QR sweep is skipped and early
*                        deflation is applied immediately to the
*                        remaining active diagonal block.  Setting
*                        IPARMQ(ISPEC=14) = 0 causes TTQRE to skip a
*                        multi-shift QR sweep whenever early deflation
*                        finds a converged eigenvalue.  Setting
*                        IPARMQ(ISPEC=14) greater than or equal to 100
*                        prevents TTQRE from skipping a multi-shift
*                        QR sweep.
*
*              ISPEC=15: (NSHFTS) The number of simultaneous shifts in
*                        a multi-shift QR iteration.
*
*              ISPEC=16: (IACC22) IPARMQ is set to 0, 1 or 2 with the
*                        following meanings.
*                        0:  During the multi-shift QR sweep,
*                            xLAQR5 does not accumulate reflections and
*                            does not use matrix-matrix multiply to
*                            update the far-from-diagonal matrix
*                            entries.
*                        1:  During the multi-shift QR sweep,
*                            xLAQR5 and/or xLAQRaccumulates reflections and uses
*                            matrix-matrix multiply to update the
*                            far-from-diagonal matrix entries.
*                        2:  During the multi-shift QR sweep.
*                            xLAQR5 accumulates reflections and takes
*                            advantage of 2-by-2 block structure during
*                            matrix-matrix multiplies.
*                        (If xTRMM is slower than xGEMM, then
*                        IPARMQ(ISPEC=16)=1 may be more efficient than
*                        IPARMQ(ISPEC=16)=2 despite the greater level of
*                        arithmetic work implied by the latter choice.)
*
*       NAME    (input) character string
*               Name of the calling subroutine
*
*       OPTS    (input) character string
*               This is a concatenation of the string arguments to
*               TTQRE.
*
*       N       (input) integer scalar
*               N is the order of the Hessenberg matrix H.
*
*       ILO     (input) INTEGER
*       IHI     (input) INTEGER
*               It is assumed that H is already upper triangular
*               in rows and columns 1:ILO-1 and IHI+1:N.
*
*       LWORK   (input) integer scalar
*               The amount of workspace available.
*
*  Further Details
*  ===============
*
*       Little is known about how best to choose these parameters.
*       It is possible to use different values of the parameters
*       for each of CHSEQR, DHSEQR, SHSEQR and ZHSEQR.
*
*       It is probably best to choose different parameters for
*       different matrices and different parameters at different
*       times during the iteration, but this has not been
*       implemented --- yet.
*
*
*       The best choices of most of the parameters depend
*       in an ill-understood way on the relative execution
*       rate of xLAQR3 and xLAQR5 and on the nature of each
*       particular eigenvalue problem.  Experiment may be the
*       only practical way to determine which choices are most
*       effective.
*
*       Following is a list of default values supplied by IPARMQ.
*       These defaults may be adjusted in order to attain better
*       performance in any particular computational environment.
*
*       IPARMQ(ISPEC=12) The xLAHQR vs xLAQR0 crossover point.
*                        Default: 75. (Must be at least 11.)
*
*       IPARMQ(ISPEC=13) Recommended deflation window size.
*                        This depends on ILO, IHI and NS, the
*                        number of simultaneous shifts returned
*                        by IPARMQ(ISPEC=15).  The default for
*                        (IHI-ILO+1).LE.500 is NS.  The default
*                        for (IHI-ILO+1).GT.500 is 3*NS/2.
*
*       IPARMQ(ISPEC=14) Nibble crossover point.  Default: 14.
*
*       IPARMQ(ISPEC=15) Number of simultaneous shifts, NS.
*                        a multi-shift QR iteration.
*
*                        If IHI-ILO+1 is ...
*
*                        greater than      ...but less    ... the
*                        or equal to ...      than        default is
*
*                                0               30       NS =   2+
*                               30               60       NS =   4+
*                               60              150       NS =  10
*                              150              590       NS =  **
*                              590             3000       NS =  64
*                             3000             6000       NS = 128
*                             6000             infinity   NS = 256
*
*                    (+)  By default matrices of this order are
*                         passed to the implicit double shift routine
*                         xLAHQR.  See IPARMQ(ISPEC=12) above.   These
*                         values of NS are used only in case of a rare
*                         xLAHQR failure.
*
*                    (**) The asterisks (**) indicate an ad-hoc
*                         function increasing from 10 to 64.
*
*       IPARMQ(ISPEC=16) Select structured matrix multiply.
*                        (See ISPEC=16 above for details.)
*                        Default: 3.

*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  XERBLA  is an error handler for the LAPACK routines.
*  It is called by an LAPACK routine if an input parameter has an
*  invalid value.  A message is printed and execution stops.
*
*  Installers may consider modifying the STOP statement in order to
*  call system-specific exception-handling facilities.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  SRNAME  (input) CHARACTER*(*)
*          The name of the routine which called XERBLA.
*
*  INFO    (input) INTEGER
*          The position of the invalid parameter in the parameter list
*          of the calling routine.
